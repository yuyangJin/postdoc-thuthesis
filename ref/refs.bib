abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving longcontent generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H2). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H2 is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H2O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H 2 tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H2O with 20\% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29\texttimes{}, 29\texttimes{}, and 3\texttimes{} on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9\texttimes{}. The code is available at https://github.com/FMInference/H2O.},

    abstract = "Today`s large language models (LLMs) typically train on short text segments (e.g., {\ensuremath{<}}4K tokens) due to the quadratic complexity of their Transformer architectures. As a result, their performance suffers drastically on inputs longer than those encountered during training, substantially limiting their applications in real-world tasks involving long contexts such as encod- ing scientific articles, code repositories, or long dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, this work identifies three major factors contributing to this length generalization failure. Our theoretical analysis reveals that commonly used techniques like using a sliding-window attention pattern or relative positional encodings are inadequate to address them. Answering these challenges, we propose LM-Infinite, a simple and effective method for enhancing LLMs' capabilities of handling long contexts. LM-Infinite is highly flexible and can be used with most modern LLMs off-the-shelf. Without any parameter updates, it allows LLMs pre-trained with 2K or 4K-long segments to generalize to up to 200M length inputs while retaining perplexity. It also improves performance on downstream tasks such as Passkey Retrieval and Qasper in the zero-shot setting. LM-Infinite brings substantial efficiency improvements: it achieves 2.7{\texttimes} decoding speed up and 7.5{\texttimes} memory saving over the original model. Our code will be publicly available upon publication."

abstract = {Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-awareâ€” accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FLASHATTENTION, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FLASHATTENTION, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FLASHATTENTION to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FLASHATTENTION trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15\% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3\texttimes{} speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4\texttimes{} speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FLASHATTENTION and block-sparse FLASHATTENTION enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4\% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1\% accuracy).},

For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks. We also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.},

Current frameworks rely on vendor-specific operator libraries and optimize for a narrow range of server-class GPUs. Deploying workloads to new platforms - such as mobile phones, embedded devices, and accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) - requires significant manual effort. We propose TVM, a compiler that exposes graph-level and operator-level optimizations to provide performance portability to deep learning workloads across diverse hardware back-ends. TVM solves optimization challenges specific to deep learning, such as high-level operator fusion, mapping to arbitrary hardware primitives, and memory latency hiding. It also automates optimization of low-level programs to hardware characteristics by employing a novel, learning-based cost modeling method for rapid exploration of code optimizations. Experimental results show that TVM delivers performance across hardware back-ends that are competitive with state-of-the-art, hand-tuned libraries for low-power CPU, mobile GPU, and server-class GPUs. We also demonstrate TVM's ability to target new accelerator back-ends, such as the FPGA-based generic deep learning accelerator. The system is open sourced and in production use inside several major companies.},

This approach misses possible graph optimizations and is difficult to scale, as new DNN operators are introduced on a regular basis.We propose TASO, the first DNN computation graph optimizer that automatically generates graph substitutions. TASO takes as input a list of operator specifications and generates candidate substitutions using the given operators as basic building blocks. All generated substitutions are formally verified against the operator specifications using an automated theorem prover. To optimize a given DNN computation graph, TASO performs a cost-based backtracking search, applying the substitutions to find an optimized graph, which can be directly used by existing DNN frameworks.Our evaluation on five real-world DNN architectures shows that TASO outperforms existing DNN frameworks by up to 2.8X, while requiring significantly less human effort. For example, TensorFlow currently contains approximately 53,000 lines of manual optimization rules, while the operator specifications needed by TASO are only 1,400 lines of code.},

Existing frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX, adopt operator-based programming to ease programming, increase performance, and perform automatic differentiation. However, as the rapid development of tensor programs, operator-based programming shows significant limitations for irregular patterns since a large amount of redundant computation or memory access is introduced. In this work, we propose FreeTensor, a free-form domain specific language which supports redundancy-avoid programming by introducing fine-grained control flow. With optimizations including partial evaluation, dependence-aware transformations, and fine-grained automatic differentiation, FreeTensor is able to generate high performance tensor programs on both CPU and GPU. Experiments show a speedup over existing tensor programming frameworks up to 5.10 \texttimes{} (2.08 \texttimes{} on average) without differentiation, and up to 127.74 \texttimes{} (36.26 \texttimes{} on average) after differentiation, for typical irregular tensor programs.},

abstract = {Kernel orchestration is the task of mapping the computation defined in different operators of a deep neural network (DNN) to the execution of GPU kernels on modern hardware platforms. Prior approaches optimize kernel orchestration by greedily applying operator fusion, which fuses the computation of multiple operators into a single kernel, and miss a variety of optimization opportunities in kernel orchestration.This paper presents Korch, a tensor program optimizer that discovers optimal kernel orchestration strategies for tensor programs. Instead of directly fusing operators, Korch first applies operator fission to decompose tensor operators into a small set of basic tensor algebra primitives. This decomposition enables a diversity of fine-grained, inter-operator optimizations. Next, Korch optimizes kernel orchestration by formalizing it as a constrained optimization problem, leveraging an off-the-shelf binary linear programming solver to discover an optimal orchestration strategy, and generating an executable that can be directly deployed on modern GPU platforms. Evaluation on a variety of DNNs shows that Korch outperforms existing tensor program optimizers by up to 1.7\texttimes{} on V100 GPUs and up to 1.6\texttimes{} on A100 GPUs.

abstract = {The validation and deployment of novel research ideas in the field of Deep Learning is often limited by the availability of efficient compute kernels for certain basic primitives. In particular, operations that cannot leverage existing vendor libraries (e.g., cuBLAS, cuDNN) are at risk of facing poor device utilization unless custom implementations are written by experts â€“ usually at the expense of portability. For this reason, the development of new programming abstractions for specifying custom Deep Learning workloads at a minimal performance cost has become crucial. We present Triton, a language and compiler centered around the concept of tile, i.e., statically shaped multi-dimensional sub-arrays. Our approach revolves around (1) a C-based language and an LLVM-based intermediate representation (IR) for expressing tensor programs in terms of operations on parametric tile variables and (2) a set of novel tile-level optimization passes for compiling these programs into efficient GPU code. We demonstrate how Triton can be used to build portable implementations of matrix multiplication and convolution kernels on par with hand-tuned vendor libraries (cuBLAS / cuDNN), or for efficiently implementing recent research ideas such as shift convolutions.},

Most existing efforts adopt a search space which lacks the ability to efficiently enable domain experts to grow the search space. This paper introduces MetaSchedule, a domain-specific probabilistic programming language abstraction to construct a rich search space of tensor programs. Our abstraction allows domain experts to analyze the program, and easily propose stochastic choices in a modular way to compose program transformation accordingly. We also build an end-to-end learning-driven framework to find an optimized program for a given search space. Experimental results show that MetaSchedule can cover the search space used in the state-of-the-art tensor program optimization frameworks in a modular way. Additionally, it empowers domain experts to conveniently grow the search space and modularly enhance the system, which brings 48\% speedup on end-to-end deep learning workloads.},

Such reliance limits the applicability of high-level graph optimizations and incurs significant engineering costs when deploying to new hardware targets. We use learning to remove this engineering burden. We learn domain-specific statistical cost models to guide the search of tensor operator implementations over billions of possible program variants. We further accelerate the search using effective model transfer across workloads.

abstract = {High-performance tensor programs are crucial to guarantee efficient execution of deep neural networks. However, obtaining performant tensor programs for different operators on various hardware platforms is notoriously challenging. Currently, deep learning systems rely on vendor-provided kernel libraries or various search strategies to get performant tensor programs. These approaches either require significant engineering effort to develop platform-specific optimization code or fall short of finding high-performance programs due to restricted search space and ineffective exploration strategy.We present Ansor, a tensor program generation framework for deep learning applications. Compared with existing search strategies, Ansor explores many more optimization combinations by sampling programs from a hierarchical representation of the search space. Ansor then fine-tunes the sampled programs with evolutionary search and a learned cost model to identify the best programs. Ansor can find high-performance programs that are outside the search space of existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, Ansor utilizes a task scheduler to simultaneously optimize multiple subgraphs in deep neural networks. We show that Ansor improves the execution performance of deep neural networks relative to the state-of-the-art on the Intel CPU, ARM CPU, and NVIDIA GPU by up to 3.8\texttimes{}, 2.6\texttimes{}, and 1.7\texttimes{}, respectively.},

We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

abstract = {Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N2) to O(N), where N is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.},

abstract = {Image processing pipelines combine the challenges of stencil computations and stream programs. They are composed of large graphs of different stencil stages, as well as complex reductions, and stages with global or data-dependent access patterns. Because of their complex structure, the performance difference between a naive implementation of a pipeline and an optimized one is often an order of magnitude. Efficient implementations require optimization of both parallelism and locality, but due to the nature of stencils, there is a fundamental tension between parallelism, locality, and introducing redundant recomputation of shared values.We present a systematic model of the tradeoff space fundamental to stencil pipelines, a schedule representation which describes concrete points in this space for each stage in an image processing pipeline, and an optimizing compiler for the Halide image processing language that synthesizes high performance implementations from a Halide algorithm and a schedule. Combining this compiler with stochastic search over the space of schedules enables terse, composable programs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of real image processing pipelines, and across different hardware architectures, including multicores with SIMD, and heterogeneous CPU+GPU execution. From simple Halide programs written in a few hours, we demonstrate performance up to 5x faster than hand-tuned C, intrinsics, and CUDA implementations optimized by experts over weeks or months, for image processing applications beyond the reach of past automatic compilers.},

TorchDynamo is a Python-level just-in-time (JIT) compiler that enables graph compilation in PyTorch programs without sacrificing the flexibility of Python. It achieves this by dynamically modifying Python bytecode before execution and extracting sequences of PyTorch operations into an FX graph, which is then JIT compiled using one of many extensible backends. TorchInductor is the default compiler backend for TorchDynamo, which translates PyTorch programs into OpenAI's Triton for GPUs and C++ for CPUs. Results show that TorchDynamo is able to capture graphs more robustly than prior approaches while adding minimal overhead, and TorchInductor is able to provide a 2.27\texttimes{} inference and 1.41\texttimes{} training geometric mean speedup on an NVIDIA A100 GPU across 180+ real-world models, which outperforms six other compilers. These extensions provide a new way to apply optimizations through compilers in eager mode frameworks like PyTorch.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as the core enabler of many major applications on mobile devices. To achieve high accuracy, DNN models have become increasingly deep with hundreds or even thousands of operator layers, leading to high memory and computational requirements for inference. Operator fusion (or kernel/layer fusion) is key optimization in many state-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks, such as TensorFlow, TVM, and MNN, that aim to improve the efficiency of the DNN inference. However, these frameworks usually adopt fusion approaches based on certain patterns that are too restrictive to cover the diversity of operators and layer connections, especially those seen in many extremely deep models. Polyhedral-based loop fusion techniques, on the other hand, work on a low-level view of the computation without operator-level information, and can also miss potential fusion opportunities. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel and extensive loop fusion framework called DNNFusion. The basic idea of this work is to work at an operator view of DNNs, but expand fusion opportunities by developing a classification of both individual operators and their combinations. In addition, DNNFusion includes 1) a novel mathematical-property-based graph rewriting framework to reduce evaluation costs and facilitate subsequent operator fusion, 2) an integrated fusion plan generation that leverages the high-level analysis and accurate light-weight profiling, and 3) additional optimizations during fusion code generation. DNNFusion is extensively evaluated on 15 DNN models with varied types of tasks, model sizes, and layer counts. The evaluation results demonstrate that DNNFusion finds up to 8.8 \texttimes{} higher fusion opportunities, outperforms four state-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks with 9.3\texttimes{} speedup. The memory requirement reduction and speedups can enable the execution of many of the target models on mobile devices and even make them part of a real-time application.},

abstract = {This work is motivated by recent developments in Deep Neural Networks, particularly the Transformer architectures underlying applications such as ChatGPT, and the need for performing inference on mobile devices. Focusing on emerging transformers (specifically the ones with computationally efficient Swin-like architectures) and large models (e.g., Stable Diffusion and LLMs) based on transformers, we observe that layout transformations between the computational operators cause a significant slowdown in these applications. This paper presents SmartMem, a comprehensive framework for eliminating most layout transformations, with the idea that multiple operators can use the same tensor layout through careful choice of layout and implementation of operations. Our approach is based on classifying the operators into four groups, and considering combinations of producer-consumer edges between the operators. We develop a set of methods for searching such layouts. Another component of our work is developing efficient memory layouts for 2.5 dimensional memory commonly seen in mobile devices. Our experimental results show that SmartMem outperforms 5 state-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks on mobile devices across 18 varied neural networks, including CNNs, Transformers with both local and global attention, as well as LLMs. In particular, compared to DNNFusion, SmartMem achieves an average speedup of 2.8\texttimes{}, and outperforms TVM and MNN with speedups of 6.9\texttimes{} and 7.9\texttimes{}, respectively, on average.},

abstract = {This work reveals that memory-intensive computation is a rising performance-critical factor in recent machine learning models. Due to a unique set of new challenges, existing ML optimizing compilers cannot perform efficient fusion under complex two-level dependencies combined with just-in-time demand. They face the dilemma of either performing costly fusion due to heavy redundant computation, or skipping fusion which results in massive number of kernels. Furthermore, they often suffer from low parallelism due to the lack of support for real-world production workloads with irregular tensor shapes. To address these rising challenges, we propose AStitch, a machine learning optimizing compiler that opens a new multi-dimensional optimization space for memory-intensive ML computations. It systematically abstracts four operator-stitching schemes while considering multi-dimensional optimization objectives, tackles complex computation graph dependencies with novel hierarchical data reuse, and efficiently processes various tensor shapes via adaptive thread mapping. Finally, AStitch provides just-in-time support incorporating our proposed optimizations for both ML training and inference. Although AStitch serves as a stand-alone compiler engine that is portable to any version of TensorFlow, its basic ideas can be generally applied to other ML frameworks and optimization compilers. Experimental results show that AStitch can achieve an average of 1.84x speedup (up to 2.73x) over the state-of-the-art Google's XLA solution across five production workloads. We also deploy AStitch onto a production cluster for ML workloads with thousands of GPUs. The system has been in operation for more than 10 months and saves about 20,000 GPU hours for 70,000 tasks per week.},

    abstract = "Processing and reasoning over long contexts is crucial for many practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as document comprehension and agent construction. Despite recent strides in making LLMs process contexts with more than 100K tokens, there is currently a lack of a standardized benchmark to evaluate this long-context capability. Existing public benchmarks typically focus on contexts around 10K tokens, limiting the assessment and comparison of LLMs in processing longer contexts. In this paper, we propose , the first LLM benchmark featuring an average data length surpassing 100K tokens. comprises synthetic and realistic tasks spanning diverse domains in English and Chinese. The tasks in are designed to require an understanding of long dependencies in contexts and make simply retrieving a limited number of passages from contexts not sufficient for these tasks. Based on , we evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs tailored for processing long contexts. The experimental results indicate that existing long-context LLMs still require significant advancements to process 100K+ contexts effectively. Furthermore, we present three intriguing analyses regarding the behavior of LLMs processing long context. Our code and data is released."

abstract = {Modern recommendation systems, primarily driven by deep-learning models, depend on fast model inferences to be useful. To tackle the sparsity in the input space, particularly for categorical variables, such inferences are made by storing increasingly large embedding vector (EV) tables in memory. A core challenge is that the inference operation has an all-or-nothing property: each inference requires multiple EV table lookups, but if any memory access is slow, the whole inference request is slow. In our paper, we design, implement and evaluate EVStore, a 3-layer EV table lookup system that harnesses both structural regularity in inference operations and domain-specific approximations to provide optimized caching, yielding up to 23\% and 27\% reduction on the average and p90 latency while quadrupling throughput at 0.2\% loss in accuracy. Finally, we show that at a minor cost of accuracy, EVStore can reduce the Deep Recommendation System (DRS) memory usage by up to 94\%, yielding potentially enormous savings for these costly, pervasive systems.},

abstract = {Deep learning based models have dominated current production recommendation systems. However, the gap between CPU-side DRAM data accessing and GPU processing still impedes their inference performance. GPU-resident cache can bridge this gap, but we find that existing systems leave the benefits to cache the embedding table, a huge sparse structure, on GPU unexploited. In this paper, we present Fleche, a holistic cache scheme with detailed designs for efficient GPU-resident embedding caching. Fleche (1) uses one cache backend for all embedding tables to improve the total cache utilization, and (2) merges small kernel calls into one unitary call to reduce the overhead of kernel maintenance (e.g., kernel launching and synchronizing). Furthermore, we carefully design the cache query workflow for finer-grain parallelism. Evaluations with real-world datasets show that compared with the prior art, Fleche significantly improves the throughput of embedding layer by 2.0 -- 5.4\texttimes{}, and gets up to 2.4\texttimes{} speedup of end-to-end inference throughput.},

  abstract = 	 {Task-specific fine-tuning on pre-trained transformers has achieved performance breakthroughs in multiple NLP tasks. Yet, as both computation and parameter size grows linearly with the number of sub-tasks, it is increasingly difficult to adopt such methods to the real world due to unrealistic memory and computation overhead on computing devices. Previous works on fine-tuning focus on reducing the growing parameter size to save storage cost by parameter sharing. However, compared to storage, the constraint of computation is a more critical issue with the fine-tuning models in modern computing environments. In this work, we propose LeTS, a framework that leverages both computation and parameter sharing across multiple tasks. Compared to traditional fine-tuning, LeTS proposes a novel neural architecture that contains a fixed pre-trained transformer model, plus learnable additive components for sub-tasks. The learnable components reuse the intermediate activations in the fixed pre-trained model, decoupling computation dependency. Differentiable neural architecture search is used to determine a task-specific computation sharing scheme, and a novel early stage pruning is applied to additive components for sparsity to achieve parameter sharing. Extensive experiments show that with 1.4% of extra parameters per task, LeTS reduces the computation by 49.5% on GLUE benchmarks with only 0.2% accuracy loss compared to full fine-tuning.}

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities, requiring huge memory with their increasing sizes and sequence lengths, thus demanding larger parallel systems. The broadly adopted pipeline parallelism introduces even heavier and unbalanced memory consumption. Recomputation is a widely employed technique to mitigate the problem but introduces extra computation overhead.This paper proposes AdaPipe, which aims to find the optimized recomputation and pipeline stage partitioning strategy. AdaPipe employs adaptive recomputation to maximize memory utilization and reduce the computation cost of each pipeline stage. A flexible stage partitioning algorithm is also adopted to balance the computation between different stages. We evaluate AdaPipe by training two representative models, GPT-3 (175B) and Llama 2 (70B), achieving up to 1.32\texttimes{} and 1.22\texttimes{} speedup on clusters with NVIDIA GPUs and Ascend NPUs respectively.},
